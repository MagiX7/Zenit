# Zenit

## Introduction

Zenit is a material editor node-based in OpenGL and C++ for the final thesis at UPC-CITM.
This tool is centered in the PBR metallic workflow, allowing to create each different textures that take part in this technique.

custom FBX model loading is also supported.

## How to generate files

All what is needed to get the files is running the file named GenProject.bat.

## Goals

One of the two main goals of this project is to understand the basis of procedural generation aswell as everything envolved when creating materials alongside a strong learning of OpenGL and its shading system.
The other one is to create a useful tool that can be used to generate textures and exporting them, allowing a posterior usage in other developing environments.

Besides that, another goal to achieve is to keep the tool as simple as possible, allowing the user to have a better experience when using it.

## Dependencies

The dependencies Zenit uses are:
  - [Premake](https://premake.github.io/)
  - [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/)
  - [Glad](https://glad.dav1d.de/)
